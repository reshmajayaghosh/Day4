      description:"<br><br>Alappuzha is a Land Mark between the broad Arabian sea and a network of rivers flowing into it.In the early first decade of the 20th Century the then Viceroy of the Indian Empire, Lord Curzon made a visit in the State to Alleppey, now Alappuzha. Fascinated by the Scenic beauty of the place, in joy and amazement, he said, “Here nature has spent up on the land her richest bounties”. In his exhilaration, it is said, he exclaimed, “Alleppey, the Venice of the East”. Thus the sobriquet found its place in the world Tourism Map. The presence of a port and a pier, criss -cross roads and numerous bridges across them, a long and unbroken sea coast might have motivated him to make this comparison.<br><br>Alleppey has a wonderful past. Though the present town owes its existence to the sagacious Diwan Rajakesavadas in the second half of 18th century, district of Alappuzha figures in classified Literature. Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala with the unending stretch of paddy fields, small streams and canals with lush green coconut palms , was well known even from the early periods of the Sangam age. History says Alappuzha had trade relations with ancient Greece and Rome in B.C and in the Middle Ages. .<br><br>Carved out of erstwhile Kottayam and Kollam (Quilon) districts, Alleppey district was formed on 17th of August 1957. .<br><br>The name of the district Alleppey, the anglicized form was changed as ‘Alappuzha’ as per  GO(P) No.133/90/RD dated 7.2.90.It is assumed that the name of Alappuzha was derived by the geographical position and physical features of the place which means “the land between the sea and the network of rivers flowing into it”. .<br><br>As per GO (MS) No.1026/82/(RD) dated 29.10.1982, Pathanamthitta district was newly constituted taking portions from the then Alappuzha, Kollam and Idukki districts. The area transferred from the erstwhile Alappuzha district to Pathanamthitta district is Thiruvalla taluk as a whole and part of Chengannur and Mavelikkara Taluks.

Alappuzha is the only district where there is no high land and forest area in Kerala. Water bodies constitute 13% of the district and Kuttanad area lies below sea level.<br><br><br><h6><b>CLIMATE</b></h6><br><br>.The climate is moist and hot in the coast and slightly cool and dry in the interior of the district. The average monthly temperature is 250 C. The district also gets the benefit of two outstanding monsoons as in the case of other parts of the state.

      image: "../../../assets/images/kochi.jpg",
      description:"<br><h6><b>DAYS OF YORE</b></h6><br><br>Ernakulam District came into being in 1958 April 1 by incorporating Kanayannoor, Kochi, Kunnathunadu, Aluva and Paroor Taluks. Deliberation for hours held at the Kerala Fine Arts Hall in 1957 and attended by a host of political, social and media activists was instrumental in the formation of the District. <br><br>The etymology of the term ‘Ernakulam’ is linked to different sources, either temple-oriented or mythological. KomattilAchutha Menon attributes the origin of the word from a type of mud called ‘Erangiyal’. Lord Siva was addressed in Chennai as ‘Erayanar’in the past. In Kerala too, this was followed and it later came to be known as ‘Ernakulam’. Ebanubathootha who travelled along the Kerala coast between AD 1342 and AD 1347 did not even make a casual reference to Kochi. The name ‘Kochi’ is a combination of two terms, Koch&Azhi (small river-mouth). <br><br>In 1405 AD, the provincial king of Perumbadappu switched its capital from Mahodayapuram to Kochi and came to be recognized as the King of Kochi paving way to the unprecedented glory of the kingdom. The traders from Portugal who had landed in Kochi by then took advantage of the feud between the king of Kochi and the Zamorin of Kozhikode. The king provided the Portughese traders all the facilities including the permission to open a warehouse. Trade flourished in Kochi. Soon there took place a battle between the Zamorin and the king of Kochi. Although the king of Kochi was defeated initially he regained his kingdom with the timely assistance of the warship from Portugal. Eventually the relation between the king of Kochi and the Portughese traders became strained and with the support of the Dutch, the king succeeded in driving out the Portughese from Kochi in 1663.Of all the kings who ruled Kochi, SakthanThampuran (1790-1805) was the mightiest and during his time the kingdom expanded. Paliathachans who belong to the Chennamangalam village were the Chief Ministers of the kings of Kochi for almost one hundred and fifty years. By 1800, the British took over the administration of Kochi and thenceforth the kings paid tributes to the British in recognition of the latter’s supremacy.<br><br><br><h6><b>ARRIVAL OF SEMITIC RELIGIONS</h6></b><br>One of the cultural distinctions of Kochi is the harmonious coexistence of people belonging to different faiths. Christians, Jews and Muslims have for long shared the legacy of Kochi along with the majority Hindus. The Jewish population in Kochi has been registering a steady decline over the years as most of them have left for Israel. It is widely believed that St. Thomas landed at the Kodungalloor Harbour in AD 52 and established seven churches. A Jewish town was set up in Mattanchery in between 1565 AD and 1601 AD for which the then king of Kochi, Kesavarama Varma provided all facilities. The Mosques in Mattanchery, Fort Kochi and Edappally are centuries old. The five hundred year old Kalvathy Mosque in Fort Kochi was built by the Arabs who had trade-ties with Kochi. In the suburbs of Kochi, Anglo Indians, Jains and the Sikhs have lived peacefully for long with a strong community spirit. <br><br><br><h6><b>PLACES TO VISIT IN ERNAKULAM</b></h6><br>Boasting a white-sandy beach, captivating island, heritage museums, and so much more, Ernakulam encompasses an array of magnificent attractions. Visit this wondrous city in God’s own country – Kerala and have a wholesome excursion.

Today the place exhibits centuries-old architectures and various social and cultural imprints left behind by foreigners. Declared as a heritage site by the government, Mattancherry has been an inspiration to historians, film-makers, travellers and artistes alike. Amongst all the Ernakulam tourist places, this museum is one of the most prominent places to visit in Ernakulam in 1 day. <br><br>Location: Mattancherry, Kochi, Kerala 682002<br><br><b>2.

      description:"<br><h6><b>Early Period</b></h6><br>The earliest evidence of human habitation in the district are rock-cut caves and megalithic burial sites of the Neolithic age. The Taliparamba-Kannur-Thalassery area abounds in rock-cut caves, dolmens, burial stone circles and menhirs, all of megalithic burial order. The district was part of the Chera kingdom, which ruled most of Kerala during the first several centuries CE. Later Kannur was the capital of the Kolattiri Rajas, whose kingdom had trading relations with Arabia and Persiain the 12th century and 13th centuries. <br><br><h6><b>Resistance To British Rule</b></h6><br>Kannur District witnessed one of the longest and bloodiest resistance to British rule in India. This revolt led by Pazhassi Raja in the 1792–1806 period kept a large part of the district in a state of war.<br><br><h6><b>Indian Feedom Movement</b></h6><br>Kannur District played an important role in the Indian freedom movement. The Indian National Congress, founded in 1885, established a Malabar District committee in 1908. A branch of the All India Home Rule League, founded by Dr. Annie Besant, functioned in Thalassery during this period and among its active workers was V.K. Krishna Menon. By the end of 1939, a branch of the Communist Party of India was formally established at Pinarayi, a village near Thalassery.<br><br><h6><b>Indian Feedom Movement</b></h6><br>Payyannur was the main venue of the Salt Satyagraha, a major turning point in the Indian Freedom Movement, in Malabar.

      description:"<br><br>Kasaragod is a place where human settlements are from the Great Stone Age. Located in the Chenkal areas in midlands of the district. Pottery, copper, and ancient ironworks provide hints for ancient humans who lived and worship agriculture and nature. Korangar, Malakkudi, Mavilar, Koppalar and Malavattu are the tribes only seen in Kasargod.Tribal people like Velan, Kadaan, Narasanar, Madigar, Bakur, Moger and Pulaiyar are also found in the district as generations of their tribal forefathers . Some places and places of worship show that the Buddhist and Jainism of the Adi Tribes had dominated places of worship. <br><br>Historians see that Vedic religion entered Kerala through Konkan and Tulu. The influence of the Vedic religion was stronger by the time of Sankaracharya. The Madhavacharya and the three-prince scholars from Koodlu Upadhippi, near Kasaragod are also part of the Dwaita-Advaita dialog. Koodlu originated from the word Kootil. Anantha Padmanabhaswamy temple in Ananthapuram near Kumbala is the only lake temple in Kerala. The temple is considered as the Moolasthana (place of origin ) of the Sri Padmanabha Swamy Temple. Ananthapuram Temple is also known as Swamy Thapassan. <br><br>Many Arab travellers, who came to Kerala between 9th and 14th centuries A.D., visited Kasargod as it was then an important trade centre. They called this area Harkwillia. Mr.Barbose, the Portuguese traveller,who visited Kumbla near Kasargod in 1514, had recorded that rice was exported to Male Island whence coir was imported. Dr.Fracis Buccanan, who was the family doctor of Lord Wellesly, visited Kasargod in 1800. In his travelogue, he has included information on the political and communal set-up in places like Athiparamba, Kavvai, Nileshwar, Bekkal, Chandragiri and Manjeshwar. <br><br>Kasargod was part of the Kumbala Kingdom in which there were 64 Tulu and Malayalam villages. <br><br>When Vijayanagar empire attacked Kasargod, it was ruled by the Kolathiri king, who had Nileswar as his headquarters. It is said that the characters appearing in Theyyam, the ritualistic folk dance of northern Kerala, represent those who had helped king Kolathiri fight against the attack of the Vijayanagar empire. <br><br>During the decline of that empire in the 14 century, the administration of this area was vested with the Ikkeri Naikans. They continued to be the rulers till the fall of the Vijayanagar empire in 16th century. Then Vengappa Naik declared independence to Ikkeri. <br><br>Kasargod was under the rule of Ezhimala dynasty. During the period of the reign of Ezhimala Dynasty Nandan Maha Raja, this region was developed from Gudalur to the north of Coimbatore. In the 14th century, Kasaragod, which became part of Kolathiri, ruled the Muthu Dynasty. The king of this genus was known as Kolathirimar. <br><br>By the end of Thalikkotta War of 1565, the Vijayanagara empire began to decline and the empire was divided into provinces ruled by the provinical kings. Ikkeri Naika Dipriya (also known as Kelji Naikkaka DTP) was the kind of dynasty. The area of Ikkeri Naikka Tipas was included in the northern part of Kasaragod and part of Karnataka, including Udupi and South Kannada districts. During this period Bekal grew up as a base for establishing the dominance of Malabar. Considering the economic significance and the importance of the security of the province decided to construct a fort at Bekal. The construction of the fort was initially completed in the days of Shivappa Naik. The construction of the fort is to defend the invasion of foreign forces. Soon the structure of the fort was completed. Chandragiri Fort was constructed during the same time. There are many interpretations in the history of the construction of Bekal Fort. The Bekal Fort was built by the Kolathiri Dynasty and later the Sivappa Naik captured it from them. Another story is Shivappa Naik in the Ikareri Dynasty himself built the fort . <br><br>Hyder Ali, the Mysore Sultan, invaded the Ikkeri dynasty in 1763 and conquered the fortresses of Malabar. However, failing to capture the Thalassery fort, Haider Ali returned to Mysore and died in 1782. Later his son Tipu Sultan conquered Malabar and gave up on the basis of the Treaty of Srirangapatnam with the British. Tipu Sultan died in 1799.In February 1800, Lord Wellesley deputed Francis Buchenan to visit the territory of the English East India Company to study the areas of the region including Mysore under Srirangapatnam agreement. On January 16, 1801, he went to Kavvayi, near the southern edge of the district and went back to Mangalapuram on 23rd of the same month. In his notes, Buchanan refers to the ancient social, cultural and political life that existed in the district during the early 19th century. <br><br>In 1804, these areas were colonized by British India, with the Neeleswaram and Kumbhala dynasties. On 16th April 1862, the South Canara district became a part of the Madras province and now it is part of the Kasaragod district and moved to Kasaragod taluk. The same status continued until the creation of the state of Kerala in 1956 after independence.<br><br><h6><b>History of freedom struggle</h6></b><br><br>The district of Kasaragod has a prominent place in the history of national independence movement. Mohammed Sheorul Sahib, the second Abdul Rahman Sahibi, was president of the Kasaragod Congress Committee. He ignored the threats of the imperialist state. Poet Kuttamath was the president of the welcome committee formed to conduct the congress meeting at Payyannur in May 1928 which was attended by Jawaharlal Nehru. Volunteer Captain Vidwan P. Kelu Nair and TS Thurumpu, K. A. Kareliyan, then KPCC president KT Kunhiraman Nambiar, Melethu Narayanan Nambair, A. C. Kannan Nair, NK Balakrishnan, K. Madhavan, Naranthatta Raman Nair, A.

They became part of the national movement through Simon Commission agitation, foreign clothing boycott, toddy shop picketing, and also were part of protests against the British policies of the Quit India movement, such as the Salt Satyagraha. They were beaten brutually during these protests. <br><br><h6><b>Katakam Forest Satyagraha</b></h6><br><br>The Satyagraha was against the Forest Act adopted by the British. After the arrest of Gandhiji in January 1932 and the declration of Congress as illegal , the leaders enetered in the Reserve Forest and fasted in protest. A. V. Kunjambu, Manjunatha Hegde, Kizhakke Valappil Kannan, Adv. Umesh Rao, Naranthatta Krishnan Nair, etc. were the lead organizers of the event. P. Krishna Pillai went to the Satyagrahis and inspired them. <br><br><h6><b>After independence</b></h6><br><br>At the time of Independence, the present area of the Kasaragod district was a taluk on the southern edge of southern Karnataka, part of Madras state. Kasaragod taluk of the then Puthoor Revenue Division. Hosdurg area was a sub taluk of Kasaragod taluk. This information was recorded in the first censorship after independence in 1951. Following the linguistic state reorganization, Kasaragod taluk was split from the southern Karnataka region and was merged with Malabar district and the state of Kerala was formed on November 1, 1956, in conjunction with Malabar-Thiruchekhi. On November 1, 1957, Malabar was divided into 3 districts of Kannur, Kozhikode and Palakkad. The division of Kasaragod and Kasaragod and Hosdurg Taluk were divided into Kannur district. The Kannur district revenue division was established by Kasaragod. The Kasaragod Revenue Division was included in the Kasaragod and Taliparamba taluk which was earlier part of the Thalassery Revenue Division. <br><br>The first Chief Minister of Kerala EMS Namboodiripad was elected from the Nileswaram constituency in Kasaragod district and the first Opposition leader in the Parliament of India, AKG Parliamentarian, was from the Kannur constituency. <br><br>The Kasaragod district came into being on 24th May 1984. The Kasaragod district, which was formed by the Kasaragod and Hosdurg taluks, was a demonstration of the popular upsurge for a thorough development of a backward region. On 28th May, 2013, Kasaragod and Manjeswaram Taluks divided by Kasaragod taluks and Hosdurg taluk split into Hosdurg and Vellirikunnu taluks. <br><br>The three municipalities are Kasaragod, Kanhangad and Neeleswaram. The Kasaragod municipality was formed on 15.08.1966, Kanhangad municipality on 01.06.1984 and the Neeleswaram municipality on 01.11.2010. There are 6 block panchayats and 38 grama panchayats in the district.<br><br>",

The capital was moved to Thiruvananthapuram, and the city expanded around the temple.

      description:"<br><br>The District can claim to have played a significant part in fostering the trade relations between Kerala and the outside world in the ancient and medieval period. It can also claim to have played an important part in fostering cultural relations and in laying the foundation of a cosmopolitan and compose culture in this part of the country. Kodungalloor which had the unique distinction of being the “Primum Emporium India”, also belongs to the signal honour of having first given shelter to all the three communities which have contributed to the prosperity of Malabar’. These three communities are the Christians, the Jews and the Muslims. <br><br><h6><b>From 9 th Centuries</b></h6><br><br>The history of Thrissur District from the 9th to the 12th centuries is the history of Kulasekharas of Mahodayapuram and the history since 12th century is the history of the rise and growth of Perumpadappu Swarupam. In the course of its long and chequered history, the Perumpadappu Swarupam had its capital at different places. We learn from the literary works of the period that the Perumpadappu Swarupam had its headquarters at Mahodayapuram and that a number of Naduvazhies in Southern and Central Kerala recognized the supremacy of the Perumpadappu Moopil. The Perumpadappu Moopil is even referred to as the “Kerala Chakravarthi” in the “Sivavilasam” and some other works.One of the landmarks in the history of the Perumpadapu Swarupam is the foundation of a new era called Pudu Vaipu Era. The Pudu Vaipu Era is traditionally believed to have commenced from the date of which the island of Vypeen was thrown from the sea.The 14th and 15 centuries constituted a period of aggressive wars in the course of which the Samorins of Calicut acquired a large part of the present Thrissur District. In the subsequent centuries the Portugese dominated the scene. By the beginning of the 17th century the Portugese power in Kerala was on the verge of collapse.About this time other European powers like the Dutch and the English appeared on the scene and challenged the Portugese. Internal dissension in the Perumpadappu Swarupam helped the Dutch in getting a footing on the Kerala Coast. As the Kerala Chiefs were conscious of the impending doom of the Portugese, they looked upon the Dutch as the rising power and extended a hearty welcome to them,.The decadence and consequential want of solidarity opened the flood gates of aggression. Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan figured very prominently during the period. <br><br><h6><b>The Architect of Thrissur Town</b></h6><br><br>In 1790 Raja Rama Varma (1790-1805) popularly known as Saktan Tampuran ascended the throne of Cochin. With the accession of this ruler the English or modern period in the history of Cochin and of the District began. It may be noted in this connection that Saktan Tampuram had been at the helm of affairs since 1769 when all administrative authority in the state was delegated to him by the then reigning sovereign on the initiative of the Travancore Raja and the Dutch Governor. As his very name suggests, this prince was a strong ruler and his reign was characterized by firm and vigorous administration. We have seen that by the end of the 18th century the power of the feudal chieftains had been crushed and royal authority had become supreme.Saktan Tampuran was mainly responsible for the destruction of the power of the feudal chieftains and increase of royal power. Another potent force in the public life of Trichur and its suburbs was the Namboodithiri community. A large part of the Trichur Taluk was for long under the domination of the Yogiatiripppads, the ecclesiastical h4eads of the Vadakkunnathan and Perumanam Devaswoms. The Yogiatirippads were elected and consecrated by the Namboodithiri Yogams of the respective places. Under their leadership the Namboodithiri families of Trichur and Perumanam were playing in active part against the ruler of Cochin in his wars against the Zamorin of Calicut. Hence after the expulsion of the Zamorin from Trichur in 1761 drastic action was taken against these families by the Raja of Cochin. The institution of Yogiatirippads was discontinued and the management of Trichur and Perumanam Devaswoms was taken over by the Government. The Namboothiri Yogams were reduced to impotence. Thus the antifeudal measures of Saktan Tampuran coupled with the several administrative reforms introduced by him marked the end of the medieval period in the history of Cochin and ushered in the modern epoch of progress.It may be interesting in this connection to know something about the institution of the Yogatirippad. The Yogiatirippad of the Vadakkunnathan Devaswom was elected by the Namboothiri illams of Trichur and its suburbs The Yogiatirippad was elected for life in the august presence of the ruler of Cochin, local chieftains and prominent Namboothiris from places outside Trichur. An interesting account of the Yogiatiri Avarodham (ceremony connected with the consecration of the Yogiatirippad) as gathered from the Grandhavari or chronicles of the Trichur temple is given by K.P. Padmanabha Menon in his History of Kerala Vol IV (p.82086). The Yogiatirippad was a very powerful and influential dignitary. The last Yogiatirippad was banished from Trichur 1763 for having joined the side of the Zamorin against Cochin. Saktan Tampuran put an end to the institution of the Yogiatirippad. Since then the numerous Namboodiri illams situated in Trichur gradually became extinct. But even today there are a few Namboothiri illams in Trichur town and its suburbs reminding one of those old days when the Namboothiri Yogam of Trichur along with the Perumanam Yogam exercised jurisdiction over a large portion of the present Trichur Taluk. <br><br><br><br>Shakthan Thampuran Palace is situated in City of Thrissur in Kerala state, India. It is named as Vadakkekara Palace, was reconstructed in Kerala-Dutch style in 1795 by Ramavarma Thampuran of the erstwhile Princely State of Cochin, well as Sakthan Thampuran (Greatest ruler of the Cochin dynasty) is preserved by Archaeological Department. The palace was converted into a museum in 2005 by State.The main structure of the Sakthan Thampuran Palace has a two-storeyed building and a traditional Kerala style Nālukettu. High roofs, extra thick walls, spacious rooms and floors paved with finely smoothened Italian marbles are some of the structural specialities of this palace. The interiors of the palace, because of its unique construction offer comfortable and pleasant staying conditions irrespective of the prevailing weather conditions. <br><br><h6><b>English Period (1805 — 1947) </b></h6><br><br>The wave of nationalism and political consciousness which swept through the country since the early decades of this century has its repercussions in the Thrissur as well. Even as early as 1919 a Committee of the Indian National Congress was functioning in Thrissur.In the Civil Disobedience Movement of 1921, several persons in Thrissur city and other places in the District took active part and courted arrest. Thrissur District can claim the honour of having been in the forefront of the country-wide movement for temple entry and abolition of untouchability. The famous Guruvayur Satyagraha is a memorable episode in the history of the national movement. The Government of Cochin under the guidance of R.K. Shanmughom Chetti followed a policy of conciliation. By degrees the public demand for the introduction of responsible Government in the State grew strong. In August 1938, Cochin announced a scheme for reforming the State legislature and introducing a system as per the Government of India Act of 1919 in the British Indian provinces. The administration of certain departments was entrusted to an elected member of the legislature to be nominated by the Maharaja.The wave of nationalism and political consciousness which swept through the country since the early decades of this century has its repercussions in the Thrissur as well.

The administration of certain departments was entrusted to an elected member of the legislature to be nominated by the Maharaja.In the elections to the reformed legislature two political parties, viz, the Cochin State Congress and the Cochin Congress won 12 and 13 seats respectively. With the help of a few independents Ambat Sivarama Menon who was the leader of the Cochin Congress Party took up office as Minister under the scheme in June 1938. On his death in August 1938, Dr A.R. Menon was appointed as Minister. When the State Legislature passed a vote of non-confidence against him, Dr Menon resigned office on 25 February 1942 and was succeeded by T.K. Nair, Nair was in office until 11 July 1945. The introduction of diarchy did not satisfy the political aspirations of the people of Cochin. The idea of full responsible Government on the basis of adult franchise had caught their imagination. On 26 January 1941 a new political organization called the Cochin State Praja Mandal took shape on the initiative of a few young politicians under the leadership of V. R. Krishnan Ezhuthachan.The Quit India movement of 1942 has its echoes in the District. After the release of the leaders from jail in 1943, the Cochin State Praja Mandal pursued its organizational activities more vigorously. In the elections to the State Legislature in 1945 it won 12, of the 19 seats contested by its candidates. At the annual conference of the Praja Mandal held at Ernakulam in 1946 it was decided to start a statewide movement for the achievement of a responsible Government. The State Legislature was scheduled to meet on 29 July, and it was decided that the day should be observed all over the State as responsible Government day. In pursuance of this decision, meetings and demonstrations were held all over the State demanding the end of Dewan’s rule and the transfer of full political power to the elected representatives of the people. The Maharaja of Cochin announced in August 1946 decision to transfer all departments of the State Government except Law and Order and Finance to the control of Ministers responsible to the State Legislature. In co-operation with other parties in the State Legislature, the Cochin State Praja Mandal decided to accept the offer. Consequently, the first popular Cabinet of Cochin consisting of Panampilly Govinda Menon, C.R. Iyyunni, K.Ayyappan and T.K. Nair assumed office. The first step towards the achievement of the goal of Aikyakerala was taken with the integration of Travancore Cochin States in July 1949. With the linguistic reorganization of States in India, in November 1956 the Kerala State came into existence. <br><br><h6><b>Post Independence Era</b></h6><br><br>In 1947, India gained independence from the British colonial rule. Cochin was the first princely state to join the Indian Union willingly. Post independence, E. Ikkanda Warrier became the first Prime Minister of Cochin. K.P.Madhavan Nair, P.T Jacob, C. Achutha Menon, Panampilly Govinda Menon were few of the other stalwarts who were in the forefront of the democratic movements. Then in 1949, Travancore-Cochin state came into being by the merger of Cochin and Travancore, with Parur T. K. Narayana Pillai as the first chief minister. Travancore-Cochin, was in turn merged with the Malabar district of the Madras State. Finally, the Government of India’s 1 November 1956 States Reorganisation Act inaugurated a new state — Kerala — incorporating Travancore-Cochin, Malabar District, and the taluk of Kasargod, South Kanara. <br><br>",
